-> Git is version control system
-> it helps manages your software project files
-> it keeps a history of events that happen with the files
-> As a developer you always want to modify and improve your code
-> thus once a functionality is developed you experiment, with that code to make it better
-> However in case of problem you want to revert back to earlier working code
-> the version control system helps you achieve this
-> it keeps the files as a old version when they are modified
-> thus at any moment you can roll back to earlier files
-> Anotehr advantages of Git is that is allows multiple developer to collaborate and work on a single project
-> also these multiple devlopers can work independently without affect each other file
-> Later code can be mereged
-> Git Hub is a web based version control system using git
-> it is open site for developers to share their code with other developers
-> it allows developers to contribute to each other's code
-> Git Hub provides developers with a platform to discuss issues they face during development
-> The developers from all over world can suggest solutions to such problems
-> this is most helpful for open source project
-> CVS(Earlier version control software used) subversion,Perforce, Bazaar are some of the other version control systems.
-> Most these systems store information as a list of file-based changes
-> these systems think of the information they keep as a set of files and the changes made to each file over time

-> working area : contains current verison of files
-> staged area : status of files is monitors, choose which files to be  
-> commit area : this area contains the files, where all the snapshot of the files are stored. it stores your previous state of git repository
